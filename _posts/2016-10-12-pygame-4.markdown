  At this event,
  we played games and learned how to make them using our favorite programming language, Python.
  Using the pygame library,
  Joe Naegele showed the group the techniques that are needed to make 2D games.
  We looked at some examples of popular games made with Python
  and had some live code samples to experience game development firsthand.
