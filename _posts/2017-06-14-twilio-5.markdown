  Matt Makai led a live demonstration of many Twilio SMS and voice services using Python.
  Walking through selecting a phone number and deploying a service,
  everyone could participate in the group text and conference call.
  Along with the services from Twilio,
  Matt covered his open source Python resource <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com">Full Stack Python</a>.
  Matt also writes a blog walking through various projects leveraging both Python and Twilio.
